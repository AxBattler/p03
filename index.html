      network of contacts and past love interests, Indy discovers that
      <span class="spoil-protect">the Nazis are searching for the legendary
      "Ark of the Covenant" featured in the Old Testament, and is able to
      outwit the fascists to recover the unspeakably powerful artifact </span>
      before it can be put to their sinister purposes.
